# [Heavy Work in Progress] 

# Custom List

This module provides functionality to create a custom list of content entities with a possibility to insert manually picked entities or configured blocks on specific positions in the list. In the background, it uses Drupal views to generate a list.

Currently, it's integrated with Default views and Search API views and for that two sub-modules are provided. 

## Note

This module requires Drupal (>= 8.6).
